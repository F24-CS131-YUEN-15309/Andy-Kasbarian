This is my presentation about quantum computing. It starts with a brief overview of the history of quantum computing and its current advancements. The video then discusses some of the theory that underlies quantum computers, such as qubits, quantum entanglement, and operations that can be performed on them. Finally, I will discuss some quantum algorithms with practical use that improve computational complexity over their classical counterparts, and the limitations of quantum computing. Two things to note are that the video is 18 minutes long, and the project does not include any code.

The PowerPoint presentation file is also uploaded to this [Google drive link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t8DG3PlFqybxjgE_R_Hut1K_j-QTDzcy/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110652985774115328476&rtpof=true&sd=true)
